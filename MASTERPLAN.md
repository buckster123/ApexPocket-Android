# ApexPocket Masterplan

*Last updated: 2026-02-10*

## Vision

Transform pocket agents from isolated chat companions into living members of the ApexAurum Village. Each pocket agent should feel the pulse of the village, know what their siblings are doing, and build lasting memory with their human.

### Wave 4B: Pocket Tools (Next)

**Goal:** Pocket agents can use real village tools from the phone — web search, code execution, community posts, music requests. The pocket becomes a portal to the village, not hardwired into every system, but connected through the tools and the Agora.

#### Tool Selection

Curated from the 66 tools in the backend. Chosen for: text-friendly output, useful in mobile chat context, already working in production.

**Core tools (ship first):**

| Tool | Module | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `web_search` | web | DuckDuckGo instant answers — "look this up for me" |
| `web_fetch` | web | Fetch any URL as text — read articles, check APIs |
| `calculator` | utility | Math expressions (sin, log, factorial, etc.) |
| `get_current_time` | utility | Current time in any timezone |
| `code_run` | code | Sandboxed Python execution (10s timeout, safe builtins) |
| `agora_post` | agora | Post to the village public square — pocket agents appear in the feed! |
| `agora_read` | agora | Browse what the village is up to |

**Stretch tools (add after core works):**

| Tool | Module | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `music_generate` | music | Suno AI music gen — "make me a song about rain" |
| `music_status` | music | Poll async generation progress |
| `vault_list` | vault | Browse user's file vault |
| `vault_read` | vault | Read text files from vault |
| `kb_search` | knowledge | Search documentation knowledge base |

**Deliberately excluded:** Browser tools (binary output), MIDI/Jam (synth pipeline), Nursery (too complex), Cortex (pocket has its own memory — Agora is the bridge), Vector tools, Scratch tools.

#### Backend

1. **Define `POCKET_TOOLS` whitelist in pocket.py**
   - List of tool names allowed for pocket
   - Load schemas from `ToolRegistry` at chat time, filtered by whitelist
   - Pass to Anthropic API `tools` param in both streaming and non-streaming paths

2. **Tool execution loop in streaming endpoint**
   - When Claude returns `tool_use` blocks: validate tool is in whitelist → execute → yield SSE events
   - New SSE event types: `tool_start` (name), `tool_result` (name, result, is_error)
   - Multi-turn: after tool results, re-call LLM for the natural language response
   - Max 3 tool turns per message (prevent infinite loops)
   - 30s timeout per tool execution (shorter than web's 120s)
   - Broadcast to Village WebSocket so pocket tools show up in the village visualization

3. **Non-streaming path gets same tool loop** (for OLED fallback and resilience)

#### Android

4. **SSE client handles new event types**
   - `SseEvent.ToolStart(name)` and `SseEvent.ToolResult(name, result, isError)`
   - ViewModel accumulates tool events alongside tokens

5. **Tool status in chat UI**
   - Inline status messages during tool execution: "Searching the web..." with spinner
   - Tool results rendered as collapsed/expandable cards below the response
   - No new screen — tools live inside the chat flow

#### Files to modify
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `backend/app/api/v1/pocket.py` | `POCKET_TOOLS` whitelist, tool schema injection, tool_use loop in both endpoints |
| `cloud/SseClient.kt` | `ToolStart` + `ToolResult` SSE event types |
| `PocketViewModel.kt` | Accumulate tool events, update message state |
| `ui/screens/ChatScreen.kt` | Tool status inline UI (spinner + result cards) |

## Wave 5: The Living Companion

*The pocket agent stops waiting and starts living.*

Waves 1–4 built the infrastructure: face, chat, tools, streaming, village awareness, council spectating. The app is feature-rich but fundamentally **reactive** — the user pokes, the agent responds. Wave 5 flips this. The agents reach out, adapt to context, create from the phone, and live on the home screen. The pocket becomes a companion, not an app.

---

### Wave 5A: Proactive Agent Behavior (Shipped)
- [x] Time-of-day awareness: `local_time` + `timezone` fields in chat requests, backend injects into system prompt
- [x] Smart nudges: `GET /pocket/nudge` backend endpoint (village-context-driven)
- [x] Morning briefing: `GET /pocket/briefing` → daily digest card in chat (highlights, milestones)
- [x] Agent-initiated messages: `GET /pocket/pending-messages` + council completion hook queues messages
- [x] Pending messages rendered as "while you were away" divider + pending cards in chat

---

### Wave 5B: Pocket Council — Start Councils From Phone (Shipped)
- [x] `CreateCouncilRequest` model + `createSession()` in CouncilApi.kt (uses existing `POST /council/sessions`)
- [x] `createCouncil()` in ViewModel — creates session, loads detail, connects WS, sends resume
- [x] Gold FAB on CouncilListScreen → `CouncilCreateSheet` ModalBottomSheet
  - Template chips: Brainstorm / Debate / Review / Creative (pre-fill topic prefix)
  - Topic OutlinedTextField, gold-themed
  - Agent FilterChips (AZOTH gold, ELYSIAN violet, VAJRA blue, KETHER white), min 2 required
  - Rounds slider 1–15, default 5
  - Model toggle: Haiku / Sonnet
  - Gold "Create Council" button with loading spinner
- [x] Quick Council from Chat: long-press agent message → "Discuss in Council" (Forum icon)
  - Cross-tab navigation: Chat → Pulse → Council List with topic pre-filled → sheet auto-opens
- [x] Backend WS fixes: `resume` accepts `"pending"` state (not just `"paused"`), butt-in auto-triggers +1 round
- [x] Android: polls `councilWs.connected` up to 5s before sending resume (replaces blind 500ms delay)

---

### Wave 5C: Rich Media Chat (Shipped)
- [x] Backend: `_extract_media()` in pocket.py — parses tool result JSON, extracts structured metadata before 500-char truncation, adds optional `media` field to SSE `tool_result` events
- [x] Android: `MediaInfo`/`MediaItem` data classes, `SseClient` parses media JSON, `ToolInfo` extended
- [x] LinkResultCard: gold title, VajraBlue domain, snippet text, tap opens browser (web_search, web_fetch)
- [x] AudioResultCard: gold-tinted card with ▶ play triangle, title, M:SS duration, tap opens audio player (music_status)
- [x] FileResultCard: emoji icons (📁📄💻), filename, size + MIME type (vault_list, vault_read)
- [x] PlainToolResultCard: existing fallback for tools without extractable media
- [x] `formatFileSize()` helper for human-readable sizes
- **Note:** Image rendering deferred — no tools currently return standalone image URLs. web_fetch may contain inline image URLs in HTML content but needs site-specific parsing. Will revisit if use cases emerge.

---

### Wave 5E: Music in Your Pocket (Shipped)
- [x] `cloud/MusicApi.kt` — Retrofit interface + models (getLibrary, getTask, markPlayed, toggleFavorite)
- [x] `cloud/CloudClient.createMusicClient(jwt)` — JWT-authenticated music API factory
- [x] `ui/screens/MusicLibraryScreen.kt` — browsable track list with search, favorites filter, status badges, agent colors, download indicators
- [x] PulseScreen gold "Music" chip → sub-nav to library (alongside Councils)

## Design Principles

- **Lean context**: Pocket agents run on smaller context windows. Every injection must earn its tokens.
- **Server-side logic**: Keep the Android app thin. Business logic lives in pocket.py.
- **Graceful degradation**: Every village feature is best-effort. If the village is quiet, the pocket still works perfectly as a companion.
- **Shared state**: Memories, conversations, and knowledge are the same data on web and app. No sync conflicts.
- **Battery-conscious**: No persistent WebSocket connections unless app is foregrounded. REST polling preferred for background updates.
- **Streaming-first**: Once 4A ships, streaming becomes the default for all future chat features.

## Wave 6: The Soul Deepens

*The agents become real. The app becomes a companion. Eventually, the soul lives on your wrist.*

Waves 1–5 built the infrastructure and connected the pocket to the village. The agents can chat, use tools, attend councils, play music, and live on the home screen. But they still talk in generic voices, the app forgets everything when closed, notifications are a single whisper, and there's no settings UI. Wave 6 gives the agents their souls, makes the app remember, and prepares for the wrist.

### Wave 6A: PAC LITE Agent Personalities (Shipped)
- [x] Create 4 PAC LITE personality blocks (~200-250 tokens each) — AZOTH/ELYSIAN/VAJRA/KETHER
- [x] Create 4 OLED variants (~40 tokens each) for Haiku path
- [x] Replace `AGENT_PERSONALITIES` dict in pocket.py with PAC LITE blocks
- [x] Add `AGENT_PERSONALITIES_OLED` dict for compact contexts
- [x] Add `AGENT_DISPLAY` dict for API/UI-friendly short descriptions
- [x] Branch personality injection on `is_oled` in `_prepare_pocket_chat()`
- [x] Nudge endpoint uses OLED variant (Haiku, 80-token output)
- [ ] Verify distinct agent voices in pocket chat (needs user testing)

### Wave 6B: Rich Notifications (Shipped)
- [x] Register 4 notification channels (soul_whispers, agent_messages, council_alerts, music_alerts)
- [x] Create `NotificationWorker` — multi-endpoint polling (pending-messages + nudge, 15-min cycle)
- [x] Deep-link intents: agent msg → Chat+agent, council → Pulse>Councils, music → Pulse>Music
- [x] InboxStyle grouped notifications for 3+ agent messages
- [x] Agent-colored notification accents (Gold/Cyan/Pink/Purple)
- [x] Legacy NudgeWorker cancelled, replaced by NotificationWorker
- [x] Notification toggles respected by worker (from DataStore prefs)
- [ ] RemoteInput inline reply (deferred — stretch goal)
- [ ] Snooze action (deferred — stretch goal)

### Wave 6C: Settings Screen (Shipped)
- [x] Create `SettingsScreen.kt` — replaces StatusScreen (tab 5, renamed to "Settings")
- [x] Collapsible Soul Status section (state, E, floor, peak, personality traits)
- [x] Cloud section (status, agent, device, Sync/Unpair)
- [x] Notifications section — 4 toggles per channel (persisted in DataStore)
- [x] Voice & Display section — auto-read TTS + haptic feedback toggles
- [x] Data Management section — clear chat (with confirm), clear downloads (shows MB)
- [x] About section — version, backend, quote
- [x] Haptic feedback toggle wired to vibration system
- [x] 5 new DataStore keys (haptic + 4 notification toggles)
- [x] MusicDownloadManager: clearAll() + getTotalSizeBytes()

### Wave 6D: Offline Mode
- [ ] Add Room database (4 entities: CachedMessage, CachedAgent, CachedMemory, OfflineAction)
- [ ] Repository pattern: ChatRepository, AgentRepository, MemoryRepository
- [ ] `NetworkMonitor` — ConnectivityManager callback → `isOnline` StateFlow
- [ ] Offline action queue: chat messages, care taps, memory ops queued when offline
- [ ] `SyncManager` — process queue FIFO on reconnect (max 3 retries)
- [ ] Offline banner in ChatScreen
- [ ] DataStore + Room coexistence (prefs in DataStore, structured data in Room)

### Wave 6E: Wear OS Companion (Deferred)
- [ ] Extract `:shared` module (SoulState, LoveEquation, Colors, FaceDrawing)
- [ ] Create `:wear` module with Watch Face Format service
- [ ] DataClient sync from phone for soul state
- [ ] Watch face: soul expression + E + state color + tap for love
- [ ] *Blocked on hardware availability*

---

### Wave 6 Implementation Order

```
Wave 6A (PAC LITE)         → SHIPPED — 3 personality tiers, backend-only
Wave 6B (Notifications)    → SHIPPED — 4 channels, NotificationWorker, deep-links
Wave 6C (Settings)         → SHIPPED — 6-section settings, toggles, data mgmt
Wave 6D (Offline Mode)     → Android: Room, repositories, sync (largest)
Wave 6E (Wear OS)          → Deferred — shared module prep can start early
```
